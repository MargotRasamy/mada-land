## A blockchain-based land registry system

### Subject :
Decentralized land ownership registry

### Description:
Today, many land registries are not always up-to-date or may have conflicting data from one land office to another. In order to avoid these problems of misinformation and non-synchronization of registers, a decentralized land property registry can be designed using blockchain technology.

### Context
The goal of this registry is, first, to allow the different land offices of a city to keep a database on the landed properties of this city as well as their owners by using blockchain technology which would allow to keep a synchronized registry, maintained and distributed between the different offices. This would avoid problems of synchronization of data on the current owners of a landed property, as well as conflicting information because since all entries are time-stamped in a system using a blockchain and immutable, it will be impossible to have different individuals as the owner of the same property, except in the case of joint ownership.
	In a second phase and depending on the progress of the project, this project will also aim to facilitate the leasing and rental of land properties based on the property certificates issued by the registry system. This second part of the project would replace an intermediary website such as AirBnb that takes fees on rentals.
